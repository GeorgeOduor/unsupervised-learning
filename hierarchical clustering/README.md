# Clustering- Hierarchical Clustering.

Unlike K-Means Clustering which choses a specified number of clusters in prioR,Hierachical clustering starts with all the data points as a cluster.It uses a bottom up(agglomerative) or top down (divisive) approach by considering each datapoint in creating clusters based on their simmilarity.
