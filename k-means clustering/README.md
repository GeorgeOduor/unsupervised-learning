# K-MEANS CLUSTERING

## What is Clustering?

Clustering means finding clusters in a dataset unsupervised.Unsupervised in this case means that there are no predictor and response variables.It is mainly used when you are working with unlabeled dataset.K-means clustering is a very popular clustering method and will be discussed in this project.
